> Control WS281X LEDs from a Raspberry Pi using TypeScript / Node.js

This is a Node.js / [Node-API](https://nodejs.github.io/node-addon-examples/) wrapper around the [rpi-ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x) library.

### Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (Tested on Raspberry Pi 4 Model B). NOTE: It will **NOT** work on Raspberry Pi 5, see: [jgarff/rpi_ws281x#528](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x/issues/528) for details.
- A WS281X LED Strip, for example one of the many [Adafruit NeoPixels](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168)
- Node.js v18.x or later

### Installation

Note: This package will only work on a Raspberry Pi.

```sh
npm install piixel

# or if you prefer to install it system-wide
npm install -g piixel
```

### Usage

See [API documentation](./docs/index.md) and the [examples](./examples) directory.

# Minimal Example

This will light up all LEDs in different colors of the color wheel.

```typescript
// example.ts

import {colorwheel, StripType, ws281x} from 'piixel'

const LEDS = 16

// Configure the library. Must be called before calling `render`.
// See APIDocs for the full list of options
// https://github.com/bjoerge/pipixel/blob/main/docs/piixel.ws281xconfig.md
ws281x.configure({
  gpio: 18,
  leds: LEDS,
  type: StripType.WS2811_STRIP_GRB,
})

const pixels = new Uint32Array(LEDS)
for (let i = 0; i < LEDS; i++) {
  pixels[i] = colorwheel((i * 256) / LEDS)
}

// Render pixels to the LED strip
ws281x.render(pixels)

// Optionally, render with brightness
ws281x.render({pixels, brightness: 0.4})
```

Use ts-node or [tsx](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx) to run

```sh
tsx ./example.ts
```

Note: Depending on which GPIO pin you use, you might need to run the script with `sudo`. See the README of [rpi-ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x?tab=readme-ov-file) for more information.

### Development

Since this library only works on a Raspberry Pi, development on other platforms becomes a bit cumbersome.
To make it easier to develop on your local machine, there's a `MOCK_PIIXEL` environment variable that can be set that will mock the hardware module and instead allow you to (optionally) render pixels to the terminal.
![terminal-mock.gif](terminal-mock.gif)

The environment variable can be set to the following values:
- `1` - Enables terminal rendering, and renders all pixels in a single row.
- `-1` â€“ Enables mocking, but turns off terminal rendering.
- `n` - Distributes pixels across n rows.
- `HxW` - Renders pixels in an HxW grid. Any pixel outside the HxW grid will be ignored.

Examples:

- `MOCK_PIIXEL=1 tsx ./my-example.ts` - Renders all pixels in a single row.
- `MOCK_PIIXEL=8 tsx ./my-example.ts` - Distributes pixels in an 8xN grid.
- `MOCK_PIIXEL=8x8 tsx ./my-example.ts` - Renders pixels in an 8x8 square. Any pixel outside the 8x8 grid will be ignored.
- `MOCK_PIIXEL=-1 tsx ./my-example.ts` - Mock the hardware module, but don't render anything to the terminal.


### Credits

- Thanks to Jeremy Garff for writing and maintaining the [rpi-ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x) C library.

- This project has taken a lot of inspiration from [meg768/rpi-ws281x](https://github.com/meg768/rpi-ws281x). It originally started as an attempt to make it work on a Raspberry Pi 4b, but I kept running into issues with random memory corruptions, so figured I'd instead write something from scratch using the [Node-API](https://nodejs.github.io/node-addon-examples/), which is more stable and future-proof than the legacy Native Abstractions for Node.js (NAN) used in that module. After the rewrite, the memory corruptions were gone.
